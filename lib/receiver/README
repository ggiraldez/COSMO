This directory contains the source code to build receiver.jar, which consists
of an Android broadcast receiver class to trigger the output of the coverage
data from JaCoCo.

You need to create a local.properties file with a single `platform.dir`
property pointing to the path where the file `android.jar` from the Android SDK
platform can be found. SDK version is not very important.

Afterwards, run `./gradlew install` which will build and install the file
`receiver.jar` in the root's `lib` directory for COSMO APK instrumenter to
find.
